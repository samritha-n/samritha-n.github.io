      <h3>EasyTrack</h3>
      <p>EasyTrack was created for the Tutorial Center at Mountain View High School to track student printing costs more efficiently. Students scan their ID cards, and printing dues are updated for each student on a Google Spreadsheet, making it easier for the coordinator to keep track of IOUs. The app received "Most Useful App" Award at the MVHS Annual App Competition. I used Android Studio for this project. </p>

      <h3>Academici</h3>
      <p>Academici is an app used to curate academic websites for students, which can be categorized and easy to access. I used Android Studio for this project. </p>
